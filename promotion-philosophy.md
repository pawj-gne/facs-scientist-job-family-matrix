# Promotion Philosophy & Design Principles

## The Core Tension

When designing a promotion matrix, organizations navigate between two legitimate models:

| Model | Philosophy | Risk |
|-------|------------|------|
| **Vacancy-Based** | "We promote when we need the role filled" | Talent flight, demotivation, "waiting for dead men's shoes" |
| **Competency-Based** | "We promote when someone demonstrates readiness" | Role inflation, budget pressure, unclear differentiation |

Most effective organizations use a **hybrid approach**. Our current framing (contribution over tenure) leans toward competency-based—which is the right instinct for scientific roles.

## Guiding Principles

### 1. Separate "Level" from "Headcount Need"

The question "do we need a Sci 3?" conflates two things:

- **Capability recognition**: Has this person demonstrated Sci 3 impact?
- **Organizational structure**: Do we have budget/need for another Sci 3?

**Recommendation**: Define promotion criteria independently of headcount. If someone is *doing* Sci 3 work (consulting, experimental design, troubleshooting complex problems), they should be recognized as Sci 3—otherwise you're underpaying for the work you're getting.

### 2. The Retention Math

Consider the cost asymmetry:

| Scenario | Cost |
|----------|------|
| Promote someone ready | ~10-15% salary increase |
| Lose and replace them | 50-200% of annual salary (recruiting, training, lost institutional knowledge, researcher relationships) |

For specialized FACS scientists, the replacement cost is toward the high end—these aren't commodity skills.

### 3. "Need" Can Be Demand-Driven or Supply-Driven

A vacancy-based framing focuses on **organizational need**. But consider the alternative:

- **Supply-driven**: "Alex has grown into Sci 3 capabilities. What new functions could we unlock?"

A strong Sci 3 might *create* the need by enabling services you couldn't offer before (new panel designs, complex experimental consulting, training programs).

## Promotion Framework

Structure promotions around **evidence of impact**, not organizational slots:

```
Promotion Trigger = Demonstrated Competency + Business Case
```

Where:

- **Demonstrated Competency** = Has performed tier-appropriate work for a sustained period (suggested: 6-12 months)
- **Business Case** = Can articulate the value they're adding at this level

### Practical Implementation

| Element | How It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| **Criteria** | Defined by the matrix (Operator → Consultant → Investigator model) |
| **Evidence** | Portfolio of work demonstrating tier-appropriate contributions |
| **Gate** | SPARC review validates evidence against criteria |
| **Budget** | Separate conversation—if criteria are met, org finds the money |

This separates the *what* (did they earn it?) from the *how* (can we afford it?).

## Pressure-Test Questions

Use these to validate the matrix design:

1. **The "Already Doing It" Test**: If someone is already performing at the next level, what's the argument for *not* promoting them? (If there isn't one, your model should recognize them.)

2. **The Flight Risk Calculation**: What happens if your strongest Sci 2 leaves because there's "no Sci 3 opening"? Can you replace their institutional knowledge?

3. **The Fairness Perception**: Will staff see the criteria as achievable and transparent? Opacity breeds cynicism.

4. **The Manager's Dilemma**: If promotions require "organizational need," managers might artificially constrain growth to avoid budget fights. Is that the behavior you want?

5. **The Differentiation Question**: If you promote based purely on competency, how do you maintain meaningful distinction between levels? (Active-verb framing helps here.)

## Recommendation

Design the matrix as **competency-based with capacity awareness**:

1. **Criteria are king**: Clear, measurable, tier-appropriate behaviors
2. **Evidence-driven**: Staff build a case; reviewers validate
3. **Retain good judgment**: SPARC can consider organizational context, but "we don't have a slot" shouldn't override demonstrated contribution
4. **Budget follows recognition**: If someone's doing Sci 3 work, find the money—the alternative is losing them

**The goal is a system where talented people see a path forward, not a ceiling.**
