## Purpose of the Job Family Matrix

### 1. Scope & Intent

The attached job family matrix describes job expectations and advancement criteria for the various levels (**SE4 to SE7**) of the Scientist job family within gRED Research.

**The matrix serves to help:**
- Managers and employees communicate and understand consistent guidelines and expectations
- Career development planning
- Annual goal setting
- Job level decisions for hiring and promotion

### 2. Role Variability

The **Scientist Promotion and Appointments Review Committee (SPARC)** recognizes that Scientist job descriptions vary depending on individual assignments:

- Discovery biology
- Technology/core-labs
- Chemistry functions

### 3. Fair Application Across Roles

The matrix provides promotion/hiring criteria that can be applied fairly to the wide variety of Scientist job descriptions, while recognizing that the specific manner in which these criteria will be demonstrated will vary depending on the candidate's current and future roles.

> **Example:** For career advancement, a Scientist who spends **80%** of their time on discovery research would be expected to contribute as a first-author or co-author on publications more frequently than would a Scientist who spends **20%** of their time on discovery research; the latter candidate would be expected to demonstrate intellectual and innovative contributions to:
> - Pipeline projects
> - INDs
> - Internal reports
> - Patents
> - Novel technology development
> - Other means

**Note:** Department-specific example criteria that delineate expected accomplishments for distinct job roles will be defined at the department level, and then approved by Committee and Research SVPs to ensure consistency across the organization.

### 4. Demonstrated Competency Requirement

> **Key Principle:** Candidates are expected to have **already demonstrated competency** at the level to which they are being promoted or hired.

### 5. Experience Guidelines

The goal of the experience section is to provide guidelines for more "typical" cases, **not** to suggest "minimal" tenure requirements.

| Aspect | Explanation |
|:-------|:------------|
| **Purpose** | Help set expectations, as it takes time and experience to grow and demonstrate success with real projects |
| **Flexibility** | Unlike the lab/group head job family, there are **no time limits** for progression through SR levels |

### 6. Process & Requirements

The processes and requirements for promotion package review and approval for various Scientist levels are described in detail at: <https://gred.gene.com/research/career-development/sprac/>

#### Seminar Requirement

| Level | Requirement |
|:------|:------------|
| **Scientist 3 (SE6)** | Hiring or promotion |
| **Scientist 4 (SE7)** | Promotions |

**Seminar Purpose:** Candidates must present a seminar (departmental seminar; research-d announcement, 11A) to communicate technical, scientific, or process accomplishments within area of expertise.
