# Project Handover: Flow Cytometry Core Job Family Revamp

**Date:** January 15, 2026
**Role Context:** Management Consultant for a Biotech Flow Cytometry Core Facility.
**Objective:** Revamp the "Scientist" (SE) job family matrix to prioritize scientific/technological contribution and lab optimization over tenure.

## 1. Core Operating Philosophy

The matrix is built on a maturity spectrum. As a team member advances, their "Customer" and "Impact Area" shift:

| Level | Role Persona | Mastery Domain | Definition of Success |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sci 2 (SE4/5)** | **The Operator** | The Instrument | High uptime, routine execution, and clean data runs. |
| **Sci 3 (SE6)** | **The Consultant** | The Experiment | Researcher success through experimental design and data troubleshooting. |
| **Sci 4 (SE7)** | **The Investigator** | The Core / Field | Lab innovation, independent R&D projects, and technical publications. |

## 2. Key Constraints & Guiding Principles

* **Non-Managerial:** This matrix is strictly for **Individual Contributors**. Manager roles have been explicitly excluded. Sci 4 is the technical/scientific pinnacle of the track.
* **Contribution Over Tenure:** Move away from "Years of Experience" (e.g., 4/8/12 years) and toward "Sustained Impact."
* **Intellectual Equity:** Advancement requires moving from "running a sample" to "owning the logic" of the experiment.
* **The "Investigator" Requirement:** Sci 4 is an R&D role internal to the core. They should run independent experiments to improve core capabilities and aim for first-author publications in methodology journals (e.g., *Cytometry Part A*).

## 3. Tier Definitions (Technical & Scientific)

### Scientist 2 (Operator)

* **Technical:** Mastery of 4-8 color experiments. Routine maintenance and basic troubleshooting (clogs, laser delays).
* **Scientific:** Basic understanding of cytometry concepts. No deep biological knowledge expected.
* **Consulting:** Basic training of new researchers on instrument startup/shutdown.

### Scientist 3 (Consultant)

* **Technical:** Expert in 10-20 color panels (Conventional and Spectral).
* **Scientific:** Collaborates on experimental design and panel construction. Troubleshoots biological artifacts (e.g., non-specific binding, dead cell exclusion).
* **Consulting:** Advises on data analysis pipelines and next-step experimental logic after outcomes.

### Scientist 4 (Investigator)

* **Technical:** High-dimensional mastery (30-40+ colors).
* **Scientific:** Leads independent technology validation (e.g., onboarding Imaging Flow or Mass Cytometry).
* **Outcome:** First-author technical SOPs or methodology papers. Independent R&D projects aligned with the facility's long-term mission.

## 4. Decision Log (Major Pivots)

* **v1.1:** Redefined "Scientific Contribution" as Intellectual Equity (consulting/design).
* **v1.2:** Rejected tenure-only model; adopted maturity model (Operator -> Consultant).
* **v1.3:** Formally defined Sci 4 as "Investigator" to distinguish it from a high-level support role.
* **v1.4:** Standardized on technical/methodology publications as the primary metric for Sci 4 distinction.

## 5. Active Work-in-Progress

* **Rewrite Strategy:** Use active verbs (Implemented, Consulted, Validated) instead of passive verbs (Familiar with, Knowledge of).
* **Missing Links:** Currently refining "Collaboration" and "Operational Responsibility" rows to match the three-tier persona model.
