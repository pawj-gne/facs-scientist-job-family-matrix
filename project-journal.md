### The Core Problem

The existing Scientist Job Family Matrix rewards highly visible accomplishments (papers, patents, projects) rather than steady, reliable execution. This creates a structural gap that disproportionately affects core facility scientists whose essential contributions are often invisible in the promotion system.

### Key Insight: Task-Based Work Has No Promotion Pathway

Staff workflow is entirely task-based and same-day—cell sorts, trainings, immunoassay submissions. There are no individual projects or sustained assignments. This means there's no built-in avenue to work on longer-term efforts that could result in scientific contributions. The promotion system assumes scientists have "projects" they can own and develop over time, but the operational model doesn't provide that structure.

### Strategic Question Raised

Should part of the solution involve **creating protected time or assignments** for staff to work on promotable efforts (method development, process improvement projects, etc.)? Or is the goal purely to reframe existing task-based work as promotion-worthy?

### The Structural Mismatch

The promotion system assumes scientists have "projects" they can own and develop over time, but the FACS team's operational model doesn't provide that structure. This is a critical point—it's not just that the work is invisible, it's that the *type* of work doesn't fit the promotion framework's assumptions.

**Two potential paths forward:**
1. **Create protected time/assignments** — Carve out opportunities for staff to work on promotable efforts (method development, process improvement projects, etc.)
2. **Reframe existing work** — Make task-based work promotion-worthy through better documentation and recognition mechanisms

These aren't mutually exclusive. May need both. Worth adding to "Questions to Resolve" in the strategy doc.
