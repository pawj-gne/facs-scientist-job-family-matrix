# CLAUDE.md - Project Guidelines

## Project Overview

This project develops a **Job Family Matrix** for Flow Cytometry (FACS) Core Facility Scientists. The goal is to revamp the "Scientist" (SE) job family to prioritize **scientific/technological contribution** over tenure.

## Key Concepts

### Three-Tier Maturity Model

| Level | Persona | Focus | Success Metric |
|:------|:--------|:------|:---------------|
| **Sci 2 (SE4/5)** | The Operator | The Instrument | Uptime, routine execution, clean data |
| **Sci 3 (SE6)** | The Consultant | The Experiment | Researcher success, experimental design |
| **Sci 4 (SE7)** | The Investigator | The Core/Field | Innovation, R&D, publications |

### Core Principles

- **Individual Contributors only** - No managerial roles in this track
- **Contribution over tenure** - Impact matters more than years of experience
- **Intellectual equity** - Advancement = owning the logic, not just running samples
- **Active voice** - Use "Implemented, Consulted, Validated" not "Familiar with, Knowledge of"

## Terminology

Use these terms consistently:

- **FACS** - Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (the technology)
- **Core Facility** - The shared lab providing FACS services
- **Panel** - A combination of fluorescent markers for an experiment
- **High-dimensional** - Experiments with 30-40+ color parameters
- **SOP** - Standard Operating Procedure
- **PI** - Principal Investigator (the researchers served)
- **SPARC** - The review committee for promotions

## Writing Guidelines

### When editing documents:

1. **Frame work as impact** - Transform duties into measurable achievements
2. **Quantify outcomes** - Include numbers (samples processed, uptime %, projects supported)
3. **Show the multiplier effect** - Core scientists enable others' success
4. **Use tier-appropriate language**:
   - Sci 2: "Executes, Maintains, Performs"
   - Sci 3: "Consults, Designs, Troubleshoots, Advises"
   - Sci 4: "Leads, Validates, Publishes, Innovates"

### Document Structure

- Use markdown tables for comparisons and criteria
- Include clear tier distinctions in any competency descriptions
- Reference the Operator → Consultant → Investigator progression
- Keep job function descriptions measurable and verb-forward

## Files in This Project

- `handover-doc.md` - Core philosophy and tier definitions
- `project-strategies.md` - Promotion framing strategies
- `job-family-matrix.md` - The actual matrix document (when created)

## Review Checklist

Before finalizing any document updates:

- [ ] Does it align with the three-tier maturity model?
- [ ] Are verbs active and tier-appropriate?
- [ ] Is impact quantified where possible?
- [ ] Does it avoid tenure-based language?
- [ ] Are FACS-specific terms used correctly?
