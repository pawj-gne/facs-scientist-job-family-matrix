# FACS Scientist Promotion Framework
## Strategic Approaches

---

## 1. Reframe "Normal Duties" as Measurable Impact

Transform routine work into documented achievements by quantifying outcomes.

| Instead of... | Document as... |
|:--------------|:---------------|
| "Maintains FACS instruments" | "Ensured 99% uptime of critical FACS instruments supporting 15 active projects" |
| "Runs samples for researchers" | "Processed 2,500+ samples across 40 projects, enabling 3 publications and 2 IND submissions" |
| "Troubleshoots equipment issues" | "Developed preventive maintenance protocol that reduced instrument downtime by 40%" |
| "Helps train new users" | "Designed and delivered training program for 25 new users, reducing failed experiments by 30%" |

**Key principle:** The work is the same, but the framing shows business impact.

## 2. Create Internal Recognition Mechanisms

If publications and patents aren't realistic for core facility work, establish internal equivalents that carry weight:

- **Technical Reports & SOPs** — Authored documents that get adopted across the organization
- **Training Programs** — Curriculum developed and delivered with measurable outcomes
- **Process Improvements** — Documented changes with quantified results
- **Cross-functional Support Letters** — Testimonials from PIs and teams served
- **Internal Presentations** — Department seminars on technical expertise or process innovations

---

## 3. Document the "Enabling" Role

Core facility scientists enable others' success. Promotion packages should capture this multiplier effect:

| Evidence Type | Examples |
|:--------------|:---------|
| **Projects Supported** | Number and scope of active projects relying on FACS services |
| **Publications Enabled** | Papers where FACS data was critical (even without authorship) |
| **Pipeline Contributions** | IND submissions, regulatory filings, or milestones supported |
| **Collaborator Testimonials** | Letters from PIs describing impact on their research |
| **Data Quality Metrics** | Reproducibility rates, QC pass rates, turnaround times |

---

## 4. Advocate for Criteria Changes

Work with SPARC to formally recognize that **sustained excellence in core operations** is itself a promotable achievement, not just a baseline expectation.

**Potential proposals:**
- Add "operational excellence" as a recognized contribution category
- Define core-facility-specific examples in department criteria
- Establish equivalency guidelines (e.g., "X hours of documented training = Y publication contribution")
- Include infrastructure/reliability metrics as promotion evidence

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Map current team responsibilities to the Job Functions table
- [ ] Identify which strategic approaches apply to each team member
- [ ] Begin documenting current work using the "reframe as impact" model
- [ ] Compile examples of enabling contributions for each scientist
- [ ] Draft department-specific criteria proposal for SPARC review

---

## Questions to Resolve

1. What internal documentation formats are already accepted by SPARC?
2. Are there precedents for core facility scientists advancing through the levels?
3. Who are the key stakeholders to involve in proposing criteria changes?
4. What metrics are currently tracked that could demonstrate impact?
