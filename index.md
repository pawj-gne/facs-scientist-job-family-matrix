# Welcome

This site is a workspace for **planning and creating a new promotion matrix** for FACS Scientists. We're rethinking how career progression should work for Flow Cytometry Core Facility Scientists — shifting the focus from tenure to contribution.

This is a living project. The documents here represent our working ideas, background research, and drafts as we develop the framework together.

## What You'll Find Here

The **Documents** section in the sidebar contains all our working materials:

- Background and context documents
- Draft criteria and philosophy
- Examples and strategies
- Planning notes and challenges

These documents will be organized into clearer categories as the project progresses. For now, browse through them to get familiar with where we're headed.
