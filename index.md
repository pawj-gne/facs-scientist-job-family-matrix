# Welcome

A career progression framework for Flow Cytometry Core Facility Scientists that prioritizes **scientific contribution over tenure**.

## The Three-Tier Model

| Level | Persona | Focus | Success Looks Like |
|:------|:--------|:------|:-------------------|
| **Sci 2** (SE4/5) | The Operator | The Instrument | High uptime, clean data, routine mastery |
| **Sci 3** (SE6) | The Consultant | The Experiment | Researcher success, experimental design |
| **Sci 4** (SE7) | The Investigator | The Core/Field | Innovation, R&D, publications |

## Key Principles

1. **Individual Contributors Only** — No managerial roles in this track
2. **Contribution Over Tenure** — Impact matters more than years
3. **Intellectual Equity** — Advancement = owning the logic, not just running samples
4. **Active Voice** — "Implemented, Consulted, Validated" not "Familiar with, Knowledge of"
