# FACS Scientist Promotion Framework

## The Core Challenge

**How do we ensure the efforts of our team are promotable achievements?**

The existing Scientist Job Family Matrix tends to reward highly visible accomplishments (papers, patents, novel projects) rather than the steady, reliable execution that keeps labs running and projects moving forward. Someone who consistently delivers quality work, maintains equipment, trains others, and keeps experiments on track may not accumulate "promotable" achievements—even though their contributions are essential.

This is a structural gap that disproportionately affects:
- Core facility scientists
- Technology/platform specialists
- Scientists in supporting roles

## Key Realities We Face

| Reality | Implication |
|:--------|:------------|
| **Publication expectations favor discovery research** | Scientists spending 80% on discovery are expected to publish more; core scientists need alternative ways to demonstrate impact |
| **"Normal duties" are invisible** | Excellent execution of routine responsibilities doesn't naturally generate promotion evidence |
| **The system rewards novelty** | Maintaining critical infrastructure is valued less than creating something new |
| **Demonstrated competency is required** | Candidates must show they're already performing at the next level—not just excelling at their current level |
| **No individual projects or sustained assignments** | Staff workflow is task-based and same-day (cell sorts, trainings, immunoassay submissions); there is no built-in avenue to work on longer-term efforts that could result in scientific contributions |
