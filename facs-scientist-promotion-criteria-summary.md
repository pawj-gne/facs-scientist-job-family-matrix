# Flow Cytometry Core Management Consultant

This summary provides a detailed breakdown of the FACS - Scientist Promotion Criteria document, structured to highlight scientific advancement and operational excellence within the flow cytometry core environment.

## 1. Executive Summary

The Scientist Job Family Matrix for gRED Research outlines the expectations and advancement criteria for positions SE4 (Scientist 1) through SE7 (Scientist 4). Its purpose is to provide consistent guidelines for career development, hiring, and promotion decisions. While specific roles vary between discovery research and core technology labs, all scientists are expected to maintain professional expertise, contribute to scientific discovery, and ensure an effective, safe research environment.

## 2. Core Competency Pillars

The current criteria can be categorized into two primary areas of focus relevant to your revamp:

### Scientific Contribution & Technical Expertise

- **Experimental Design & Analysis:** Progresses from setting up 4+ color experiments to 16+ color (conventional) and 20+ color (full spectrum) experiments.
- **Specialized Technologies:** Proficiency in advanced platforms such as Helios, Influx, ImageStream, and Penteon.
- **Knowledge Application:** Moving from learning basic theory to independently evaluating new technologies and contributing intellectual insights that advance internal processes.
- **Dissemination of Findings:** Includes posters at conferences (e.g., Asilomar), publications, patents, and external presentations (e.g., ISAC, webinars).

### Lab Functionality & Operational Excellence

- **Instrument Maintenance:** Evolves from routine QC and cleaning to advanced self-repairs and managing instrument repair processes through external groups.
- **Workflow Management:** Includes planning daily sorting schedules, adjusting throughput on-the-fly, and acting as a supervisor/manager for short periods to maintain workflow.
- **User Support & Training:** Transitioning from training new users on analyzers to acting as a "technical go-to person" and consultant for complex panel design and instrument choice.
- **Logistics & Safety:** Active roles in supply ordering, waste management, and serving on research safety teams.

## 3. Level-by-Level Matrix Summary

| Level | Experience Guidelines (FACS Specific) | Key Scientific/Technical Milestone | Key Lab Functionality Milestone |
|-------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Scientist 1 (SE4)** | 4+ yrs hands-on experience with analyzers. | Proficiency in 4+ color experiments and basic software (DIVA, FlowJo). | Proficient in routine startup, QC, and shutdown with minimal supervision. |
| **Scientist 2 (SE5)** | 8+ yrs analyzer exp; 4+ yrs sorter exp. | Proficiency in 10+ color experiments; working knowledge of tSNE/FlowSOM. | Ability to handle side projects independently; basic instrument self-repair. |
| **Scientist 3 (SE6)** | 12+ yrs analyzer exp; 8+ yrs sorter exp. | Proficiency in 16-20+ color experiments; expert in multiple specialized instruments. | Leading group-wide process changes; advanced self-repairs; acts as a role model. |
| **Scientist 4 (SE7)** | Extensive experience across diverse projects. | Recognized external expert (awards, webinars); serves as a functional area leader. | Proactively evaluates and identifies new technologies to advance internal processes. |

## 4. Promotion & Appointment Requirements

- **Demonstrated Competency:** Candidates must already demonstrate the level of competency of the role to which they are being promoted.
- **Seminar Requirement:** For promotion to Scientist 3 (SE6) and Scientist 4 (SE7), candidates must present a departmental or "Research-D" seminar to communicate technical or scientific accomplishments.
- **Performance Evidence:** Advancement is evidenced by a track record of reliable results, scientific contributions (papers/patents), and letters of reference for higher levels.
- **Committee Approval:** Promotions for SE6 and SE7 require review by the Scientist Promotion and Appointments Review Committee (SPARC) and Research SVPs.
