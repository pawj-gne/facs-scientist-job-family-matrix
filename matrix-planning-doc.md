# Project: Flow Cytometry Core Job Family Matrix Revamp

**Current Version:** v1.6 (January 15, 2026)
**Status:** Strategic Alignment Confirmed

---

## 1. The Living Manifesto

**Mission:** Redefine the Scientist track from a tenure-based service role to a contribution-based career path.

### Guiding Principles

1. **No Barriers to Advancement** — Changes are not meant to hold anyone back from a promotion
2. **Merit Over Tenure** — Moving to a clearer promotion process that rewards sustained contributions over time in role
3. **Equitable Growth** — Create a system that values different strengths and gives everyone a fair chance to grow and get promoted

### The Three-Tier Evolution

| Role | Title | Focus |
|:-----|:------|:------|
| **Sci 2** | Operator | Machine Expert. Focuses on technical execution and instrument uptime. Biology knowledge is not a primary expectation. |
| **Sci 3** | Consultant | Project Expert. Focuses on researcher success through experimental design, analysis pipelines, and biological troubleshooting. |
| **Sci 4** | Investigator | Core/Field Expert. Focuses on the Lab's mission. Leads independent R&D, implements new technologies, and publishes first-author methodology papers. |

### Key Constraints

- Exclude "Manager" roles from this specific matrix
- Shift criteria from "Years of Experience" to "Complexity of Contribution"

## 2. Versioned Decision Log

*Tracks how ideas evolve, including the reasoning behind changes and what they replaced.*

| Version | Date | Category | Decision | Rationale | Supersedes |
|:--------|:-----|:---------|:---------|:----------|:-----------|
| v1.1 | 2026-01-15 | Philosophy | Defined Scientific/Technological contributions as "Intellectual Equity" | Needed a term that captures non-monetary value creation | — |
| v1.2 | 2026-01-15 | Structure | Established the transition from Operator (Sci 2) to Consultant (Sci 3) | Clearer role differentiation based on focus area | — |
| v1.3 | 2026-01-15 | Structure | Defined Sci 4 as "Investigator" with independent research goals | Distinguishes senior role from consulting work | — |
| v1.4 | 2026-01-15 | Metrics | Clarified publication focus for Sci 4: Technical/Methodology journals | Aligns with core facility mission vs. biological discovery | — |
| v1.5 | 2026-01-15 | Admin | Created handover-doc.md; separated strategic context from working matrix | Maintains clean separation of concerns | — |
| v1.6 | 2026-01-15 | Philosophy | Added Guiding Principles: No Barriers, Merit Over Tenure, Equitable Growth | Establishes mission statements for the revamp project | — |

**Categories:** Philosophy | Structure | Metrics | Competency | Admin

### How to Use This Log
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Rationale**: Why this decision was made
- **Supersedes**: Reference to earlier version if this changes a previous decision (enables tracing idea evolution)

## 3. Structural Mapping (The Operator → Investigator Spectrum)

| Level | Focus | Knowledge Domain | Primary Output |
|:------|:------|:-----------------|:---------------|
| **Sci 2** | The Instrument | Optics, Fluidics, Basic QC | Successful Runs |
| **Sci 3** | The Experiment | Panel Design, Data Analysis | Researcher Success |
| **Sci 4** | The Core Lab | Tech Implementation, R&D | New Methods/Pubs |

## 4. Open Questions

*Unresolved items requiring further discussion or research.*

| ID | Question | Context | Status |
|:---|:---------|:--------|:-------|
| Q1 | How do we handle staff currently between tiers? | Transition planning | Open |
| Q2 | What metrics best demonstrate "sustained contributions"? | Aligns with Guiding Principle #2 | Open |
| Q3 | Should there be lateral movement options within tiers? | Career flexibility | Open |
